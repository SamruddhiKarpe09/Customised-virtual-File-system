# Customised-virtual-File-system

# Programming language - C programming

# Description -  This Project is the virtual representation of file System.

# File System is considered as the way of storing the information about filesdata from the files into secondary storage device

# In this Project, we implement the layout of complete file system from RAM.

# In this project, we implement almost every related system call used in the file manipulation activity along with some important commands.

# This is a Research based project . We develop this project to understand internals of an operating System and to explore the data structures implementation of c programming.
